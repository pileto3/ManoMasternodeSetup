# ManoMasternodeSetup

I do not have a formal guide at this time. 
   That being said, All you have to do is run these commands and follow on screen instructions. 

```bash 
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git
git clone https://github.com/Dwigt007/ManoMasternodeSetup.git
cd ManoMasternodeSetup && bash mano-setup.sh

```
If you can follow those lines and the on screen instructions you will not have a problem! Please reach out on discord @-dwigt-, if you need any assistance or hosting.
